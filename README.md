# Buffalo First Data Server

This project is currently depreciated in favor of <a href="https://github.com/nathanmargaglio/reala">Reala</a>, which is currently in production.

Buffalo First Data Server is the predecessor of Reala.  BFDS is a single-page web app which runs a Flask-based RESTful API backend with a jQuery built front-end.  The site is designed to track and organize contacts so that a realty group can leverage a pool of leads for consistent contact with potential clients.

Everything is being hosted on Google's Cloud Platform.  This code is not maintained and will be deleted soon.

The site can be found at http://buffalodataserver.com/
